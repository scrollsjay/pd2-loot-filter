## Credits

This Loot Filter uses [Kryszard's PD2 Loot-Filter](https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter) for most of it's filter rules. It's really great and you should check it out!

The basic potion naming schema was adopted from [ElPocoBurrito's Filter](https://github.com/rockbyo5/PocoLootFilter/).


# Changes

The changes made were mostly to allow for a briefer appearance of basic items to present a unified look.

#### Overview
- **Gold**: show more gold with finer steps in between based on clvl
- **Potions**: health/mana/rejuv potion names are shortened a lot, e.g. "H2" for "Super Health Potion"
- **Keys/Antidots**: are hidden for clvl>30
- **Gems**: short and unified gem names, e.g. "Flawless Sapphire [O]" -> "(O4) Sapphire"
- **Runes**: adjusted naming with coloring and rune number, e.g. "#15 Hel Rune"
- **Notifications** for all drops of: runes, set and unique items
- **Quantity**: darker coloring


## Potions

Health/Mana potions are enumerated with a "Minor Healing Potion" becoming a "H1" and a "Super Mana Potion" becoming a "M5". Rejuvenation potions are altered the same way, now being "R1" and "R2".
