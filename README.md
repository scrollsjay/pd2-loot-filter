## Credits

This Loot Filter uses [Kryszard's PD2 Loot-Filter](https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter) for most of it's filter rules. It's really great and you should check it out!

The basic potion naming schema was adopted from [ElPocoBurrito's Filter](https://github.com/rockbyo5/PocoLootFilter/).


# Changes

The changes made were mostly to allow for a briefer appearance of basic items to present a unified look.


## Potions

Health/Mana potions are enumerated with a "Minor Healing Potion" becoming a "H1" and a "Super Mana Potion" becoming a "M5". Rejuvenation potions are altered the same way, now being "R1" and "R2".
